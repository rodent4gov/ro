  		<p id="sh">The Rodent Oligarchy Party is an organization devoted to the abolishment of the centralized U.S. government in favor of multiple self run oligarchies of rodents for each U.S. state. We believe that humans are a naturally very flawed, corrupt, and cruel race, and are unfit to run our modern world. Rodents on the other hand have started no wars, no hate groups, and work together perfectly. With a government of rodents, we would be able to have a much more bipartisan legal system, and we would be better protected against the modern threat of nuclear attack, due to rodents natural proliferation and size. The rodents survived even the great extinction of the dinosaurs, and would let our great countries live on, even in the case of unexpected annihilation. This is a fully fledged movement which hopes to right the wrongs of the past, and elevate the humble rodent to its rightful place among the gods. We have made so many mistakes as a species, and this is our time for a second chance. <br>
Remember: Be kind. Be rational. Vote rodent.
